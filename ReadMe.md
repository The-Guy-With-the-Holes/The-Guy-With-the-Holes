About this Repo::

It is my firm belief that people need a foothold to plant their beliefs, and allow their seeds of the future to grow.

This is my foothold, I will stand here, trying to build my castle. 'till my fingers are bloody and my mind is numb. This is the moment in time and history i start creating my kingdom in the sky.
Look at mine, then go and make yours.
This is our ONLY shot.

This is MY BUSINESS, but you are welcome to my card.

<!---

The-Guy-With-the-Holes/The-Guy-With-the-Holes is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile and the person who created it is pretty wonderful (LOL)

(It's like a social media for coders , Web2 was wild, Web3 is about to be INSANE)
